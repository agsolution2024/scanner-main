# Atomic Design Structure

This project follows the Atomic Design methodology, a systematic approach to creating and maintaining scalable design systems. The structure is organized into the following hierarchical levels:

## atoms/
The fundamental building blocks that cannot be broken down further:
- Buttons (primary, secondary, icon buttons)
- Typography (headings, body text, captions)
- Form Elements (inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, switches)
- Icons & Visual Elements
- Design Tokens (colors, spacing, shadows, animations)
- Accessibility Elements (labels, aria components)

## molecules/
Simple combinations of atoms that form reusable components:
- Form Controls (input groups, validation messages)
- Interactive Elements (dropdowns, tooltips)
- Media Components (avatars, thumbnails)
- Action Groups (button groups, toggle sets)
- Status Indicators (badges, progress bars)
- Data Display (key-value pairs, stats)

## organisms/
Complex UI components composed of molecules and/or atoms:
- Navigation Components (nav bars, sidebars, breadcrumbs)
- Complex Forms (multi-step forms, search interfaces)
- Content Containers (cards, modals, dialogs)
- Data Tables & Lists
- Feature Sections (hero units, testimonials)
- Interactive Widgets (carousels, accordions)

## templates/
Page-level structures that arrange components into layouts:
- Layout Systems (grid systems, flex containers)
- Page Templates (dashboard, article, profile)
- Responsive Patterns
- Section Layouts
- Component Composition Rules
- Loading States & Placeholders

## pages/
Specific instances of templates with real content:
- Route-based Pages
- Dynamic Content Views
- State Management Integration
- Data Flow Examples
- Feature Implementations

## Best Practices
- Components should be composable and follow single-responsibility principle
- Maintain consistent prop interfaces across related components
- Implement responsive design at each level
- Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG) throughout the component hierarchy
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Document component APIs and usage examples
- Include unit tests for components
- Consider performance implications at each level

Note: This structure serves as a flexible foundation for creating consistent, reusable, and maintainable UI components. While following atomic design principles, components can be adapted based on specific project needs and modern development practices.
